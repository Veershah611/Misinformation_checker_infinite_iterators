# AI Fact-Checker Application

This is a full-stack fact-checking application that uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model to analyze and verify claims from text, URLs, and files (images/PDFs). The frontend is built with Next.js (React) and the backend is a Flask (Python) server.

## Features

-   **Text Analysis**: Enter any claim or statement for verification.
-   **URL Analysis**: Provide a URL to have its content scraped and fact-checked.
-   **File Analysis**: Upload images (`.png`, `.jpg`) or PDFs for multimodal analysis.
-   **Multilingual Support**: Input claims in various languages; the output will be translated back to the source language.
-   **Categorized Results**: The analysis is broken down into supporting and refuting points for clarity.

##  Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have the following installed on your system:

1.  **Python** (3.8 or newer)
2.  **Node.js** and **npm** (or yarn/pnpm)
3.  **Tesseract OCR Engine**: The backend uses Tesseract to extract text from images. This must be installed on your system.
    -   **Windows**: Download and run the installer from [Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). Make sure to add the installation directory to your system's `PATH`.
    -   **macOS (using Homebrew)**: `brew install tesseract`
    -   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup (Flask Server)

Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.

**a. Create a Virtual Environment:**
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

**b. Install Python Dependencies:**
Install all the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**c. Set Up Environment Variables:**
You need to provide your Gemini API key. Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as `app.py`.

Add your API key to this file:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**d. Download Local Datasets:**
Make sure you have the `IFND.csv` and `news_dataset.csv` files in the same directory as `app.py`.

### 2. Frontend Setup (Next.js App)

Navigate to your Next.js project directory (the one with `page.tsx`).

**a. Install Node.js Dependencies:**
If you haven't already, install the necessary packages.

```bash
npm install
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

You need to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously in separate terminal windows.

**1. Start the Backend Server:**
- Open a terminal, navigate to the backend directory, and activate your virtual environment.
- Run the Flask app.

```bash
flask run
```
You should see output indicating the server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

**2. Start the Frontend Server:**
- Open a *second* terminal and navigate to the frontend directory.
- Run the Next.js development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```
You should see output indicating the server is running on `http://localhost:3000`.

**3. Open the App:**
Open your web browser and go to **`http://localhost:3000`**. You can now use the application. The frontend will make requests to your local backend server running on port 5000.
